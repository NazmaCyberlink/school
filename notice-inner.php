                        <p style="margin:25px 0px;">“The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.” I was one of the lucky students who had the chance to participate in an international student exchange programme, an initiative of the College. The aim of this program was to broaden the cultural spectrum of the students.

                            In the present where globalization is the new trend, being familiar with other's culture comes in handy, especially if the culture and society in question is that of our neighboring country, India. This initiative was meant to narrow the cultural gap. Additionally, it also broadened my friend circle, and provided me with valuable learnings.</p>

                    <p>
                        The exchange program aimed to introduce students to unconventional educational methods through which they can gain the utmost knowledge and experience different cultures in a short period of time. It is a basic requirement for students today to have access to internationally applicable education. So with these aims in mind, the college strives to develop an inclusive programme that expands their worldview and assists them in succeeding.

                    <p>On the first day of the Jaipur Student Exchange Programme, Norbu Wangchuk, Bhutan's former education minister, presided over the opening ceremony. Wangchuk was a modest person who, in addition to being arenowned educationist, wore the traditional Bhutanese outfit to spread the message of accepting one's culture. The session was inspiring and insightful, and frankly the participation was overwhelming. It brought many students from various walks of life together for a simple purpose of understanding cultural gaps and concentrating on collective goals.</p>
                    <p>It was an honor for all of us to be able to represent our nation, community, and college on a global stage. I am eternally grateful to all of my friends and professors who made my trip to Jaipur so memorable. Moreover, the College deserves every bit of credit for providing us with this once-in-alifetime and extremely valuable opportunity.</p>
